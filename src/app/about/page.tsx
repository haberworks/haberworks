            Hey, Justin here. Welcome to my lil vibe-coded website. Just messin&apos; around with a prototying process. At work, I do product management.
            Outside of work, maybe the same thing?  I&apos;ve spent over a decade in tech, working
            with some awesome people on some interesting projects, and formed lifelong friendships in the process, forged in the fires of start-ups and top-downs. 
          </p>
          <p className="about-paragraph">
            Outside of work, I&apos;m an avid tinkerer and thinkerer. See, here I&apos;m messing around with stuff I may not fully understand. But that is life. 
            Stuff I may know a bit more about includes my loving family and friends, my incredible fianc√©e Ashlynn (a real developer who rightfully judges my hack-work) and our cat Butters (who just wants to eat), my extensive collection of bass guitars that I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jhawkins.nightshift/" target="_blank">still play sometimes</a>,
            my Steam library which continues to increase in size and dust accumulation, baseball (Let&apos;s Go Mets!), <a href="https://boz-float.itch.io/" target="_blank">making music for indie games</a>, <a href="https://gibby.games/" target="_blank">marketing for home grown board games</a>, and making tasty creations for the people I love in my kitchen. I&apos;m pretty domesticated but don&apos;t often feel like it. 
            Maybe I feel right at home in that state of in-between.
